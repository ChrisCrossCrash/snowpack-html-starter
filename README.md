**Note: This repository has been archived because [Snowpack is no longer actively maintained](https://github.com/FredKSchott/snowpack). For a more up-to-date starter template, please check out the [Vite TypeScript Starter](https://github.com/ChrisCrossCrash/vite-ts-starter) repository.**

A very simple HTML, SCSS, and JS starter. It's a great alternative for using Codepen when you just want to try something simple.
